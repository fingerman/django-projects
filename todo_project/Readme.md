To-Do Web App (Django Framework)

Tools:

* simple forms with views. Widgets (not model forms)
in this way _form.py_ statements overwrite the field options in _models.py_  
* use the class forms.ModelForm if you might want to skip defining the field
 types of our forms, because we already defined them in the model  
* keep forms, models, urls and views in same dir as it is small app  
*
